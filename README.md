# EM Algorithm Examples
### By Patrick Mellady

This repository contains a derivation and code implementation of the EM algorithm for two classic problems: mixture distributions and missing data. 
See the EM Algorithm Examples pdf for the full derivation and explanation of the method as well as the code and results. To run the code yourself, download
the EM.r file.
